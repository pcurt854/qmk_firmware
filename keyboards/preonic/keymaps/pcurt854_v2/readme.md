# For programmers having trouble touch typing the top row

After pcurt854 was merged into master, I kept improving these mappings.
This folder will keep track of these changes.
I hope it will be a better, more meaningful, and easier to use version of pcurt854.

### My problem and using preonic to solve it

I am an okay letter typist, but often need to look and find special symbols, like $ and ^, on the top row.  Using layers, I assigned most special symbols to keys corresponding to their names.

When entering many numbers, I like to use the numpad.  But the numpad on a full-sized keyboard is simply too far away.  Staggered keyboard makes it awkward to move the numpad in.  Preonic is ortholinear, of the right size, and can accommodate the numpad quite easily.  On the same layer, I also included rows of 1-5 and 6-0.  For a one-off number, the latter is often the simpler way to go.

For programmers, parentheses, brackets, and braces are important.  They are put right under the fingers in an easy-to-remember layout as well.

### Layer 0

The middle section, from 1 to 0, plus three rows of letters, follows the traditional QWERTY layout.

The left border, from top to bottom: Esc when tapped and ~ with Shift and ` with Command, Tab, Esc when tapped and Control when held, and Layer 5 access.

The right border: Backspace, Tap dancing leader key, Quotes, and Layer 6.

Bottom row, left to right: One shot modifier Left shift, Control, Option, Command, Layer 4, Enter, Space, Layer 3 double tap to toggle, Slash (moved here to allow for a traditional cluster of arrows), Left, Down, and Right.

### Layer 1

Middle: Colemak

Border: Same as QWERTY

### Layer 2

Middle: Dvorak

Border: Same as QWERTY

### Layer 3

Numpad and common operators around it, with the left side of keyboard filled with rows of 1-5 and 6-0

Home/End/Page Up/Page Down in place of arrow keys

### Layer 4

Special symbols using a character in their names, mostly:

pLus (+), pIpe (|)

aNd (&), dollaR ($)

At (@), Backslash (\\), Circumflex (^), Exclamation (!), Grave (`), Hash (#), Percent (%), Star (*), Tilde (~), Underscore (_)

Some symbols moved away from their original positions:

* minus (\-) is put on J so it's under Underscore, easy to access, and matches the bump on the J key

* equal sign (=) is put on M, under J (moved away from eQual to avoid accidental Command-Q)

* In the final layout, _, \-, and = are in a single column.

Same Home/End/Page Up/Page Down cluster as that on Layer 3

### Layer 5

Brackets, and RGB backlight controls

### Layer 6

Reset, Caps lock. Base layer switches, Volume controls, and other special functions

### RGB backlight

... is used to indicate the status of Cap locks and which of the higher layers is on.

RGB mode keys were put on Layer 5 because some modes work better with the layer indicators than others do.

Velocikey was turned on for some fun.

### Tap dancing

With the Leader key, Tap dance the brackets: <> () [] {}, Cap lock, some numbers, and some simple phrases.
